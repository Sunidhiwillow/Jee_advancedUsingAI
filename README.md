# Jee_advancedUsingAI
## Description
Ever wondered how Large Language Models (LLMs) would perform on one of India's most challenging entrance exams, the JEE Advanced? Can they reason through and solve these complex problems? Let's find out in this project, where I put AI to the test against some of the toughest questions students face.

## Implementation
In this project, I compared the performance of several state-of-the-art language models:

Gemini API
LLaMA
OpenAI GPT
These models were evaluated based on their ability to solve JEE Advanced problems, a benchmark known for its difficulty and complexity.
I used the LangChain library to seamlessly integrate and manage these models, ensuring smooth and efficient processing of the tasks at hand.
